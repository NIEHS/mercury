## Run a comparative analysis of daily temperature products across the US

We investigate the Urban Heat Island (UHI) representativeness in different products:

- daymet (daily ~1km- resolution)

- gridMET (daily ~4km-resolution)

- mobile measurement campaign HEATWATCH (NOAA + CAPA) 

- our own product developped with a Bayesian approach with personal weather stations [samba](https://github.com/NIEHS/samba) (hourly, ~1km-resolution)
